## 📜 Words to Live By

> "When I'm programming, I try to write the best code possible because it's a piece of me, my soul, my intention to solve a problem that will persist for a long time. If I don't have the best intentions, the problem will be solved poorly for a long time." – Inspired by the CTO of Nubank [Vitor Olivier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-olivier)

> "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." – **Cory House**
